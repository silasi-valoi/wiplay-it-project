Wiplayit project is a social network for football professionals and alike where a user can ask questions about anything related to football and get an answer from another user who might have an answer to that question.

The Question and Answer feature is not the only thing the platform does. The platform again allows users to create posts, follow questions, create comments to answers and post, upvote answers, posts, comments, and edit their profiles.

The app is powered by Python/Django on the backend and Javascript/React on the browser
